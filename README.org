#+title: A Path type for Base Julia

This is part of the [[https://hackmd.io/@tecosaur/SyMYFLhG1g][Charting a Path for Julia]] proposal.

Currently, this is both a prototype and an experiment. Some parts I am confident
will be part of the final proposal (e.g. ~AbstractPath~), others components are
being tried so that we can evaluate whether they're worth having (e.g. path buffers).
